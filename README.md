# employee-summary
This app will generate a webpage with teammate's info.

This app will ask the user several questions and will generate an employee card for them based of that information.

This app uses classes for each individual employee with unique data points, the parent class is Employee.

This app also uses supers to access the parent class of Employee. The types of employees are interns, engineers, and managers.

This app also uses several functions within one major function to determine what type of employee the user is.

From there, a switch method is used to separate the types of employees with questions specifically designated for said employees.

Once complete, the HTML will generate an employee card.
